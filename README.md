the boi that gets shit done

once you clone or pull or whatever, type `npm install` in the main directory, that will install the dependencies `discord.js` and `dotenv`.
Once installed and ready, create a `.env` file and create a variable like this `TOKEN=YourActualBotToken`.
It is done now, so you can just `node index.js` and be happy.
