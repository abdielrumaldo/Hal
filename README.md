the boi that gets shit done

NOTE: "You need NODE.JS installed"

1. Download, clone, pull, or whatever.
2. Type `npm install` in the main directory (will install `discord.js` and `dotenv`).
3. Create a `.env` file and put a new variable like this `TOKEN=YourActualBotToken`.
4. It is done now, so you can just `node index.js` and be happy.
